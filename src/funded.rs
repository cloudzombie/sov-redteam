//! **Funded-adversary probe** — attack the live chain AS a real, funded account, probing
//! it the way a thief would: try to spend the same coins twice, replay a payment, rewind
//! the nonce, front-run yourself, and drain an account you don't own.
//!
//! Every other live probe uses zero-balance throwaways. This one holds a REAL key the
//! operator pastes and controls real XUS. It first proves control with an honest net-zero
//! self-transfer (the ONE tx that lands — value leaves and returns to the same account,
//! only a gas fee spent), then runs a THEFT campaign whose every attempt the chain must
//! refuse:
//!   - double-spend the whole balance to a thief (nonce reuse) → refused (one tx / nonce),
//!   - front-run / replace-by-fee (swap recipient on the same nonce) → refused (no RBF),
//!   - replay the payment to drain twice → refused (already pooled),
//!   - rewind the nonce to re-spend a past state → refused (stale nonce),
//!   - drain an account we don't own (wrong signer) → refused (unauthorized).
//!
//! It also tries to CREATE value from nothing — a mint-from-thin-air and an integer
//! overflow — fired live but signed by THROWAWAY empty accounts, so a node with the
//! mempool affordability gate rejects them at admission (no value, no wedge) and a node
//! that predates the gate only strands the throwaway, never the funded account.
//!
//! SAFETY: the theft attempts are all rejected at admission (or, for the mint attempts,
//! signed by throwaways), so none consume the funded account's nonce or move its coins;
//! only the honest self-transfer lands (a small gas fee).
